## Reflection

When reading the through the chapter we should reflect on the importance of polices when working on code and what will having a good set of rules and style guides do for our project devolpment teams. For one, they should help address the challenges of using features of the tools correctly, which can introduce bugs if not applied properly. We have a built in interactive feature for the command line interface that assists in writing correct arguments so that the tools run correctly. Rules should also enforce best practices, rules should be aimed to make source code more readable. We have automatic linters that will reformatt any code implemented to match the standard for the whole project. As software engineers, we all have a different style of writing code, so to make code more readable and understandable it is important to establish consistency within formatting and syntax. Said consistency will also help with better scalability and debugging. As software projects become larger and more complex, establishing a set of styleguids and rules becomes more important. These rules play a crucial role in keeping the code structured and easily maintainable. They act as a safeguard against the code becoming chaotic, which would make it challenging to make modifications to the software. Also when code follows a predictable pattern, it becomes easier to recognize and address problems or errors for debugging.
