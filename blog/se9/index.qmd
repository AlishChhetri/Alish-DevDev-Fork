## Reflection

In this section about Google's software engineering, the focus is on the critical practice of code review
before integrating changes into the main product, highlighting Google's comprehensive approach which emphasizes accuracy,
uniformity, knowledge transfer among developers, and thorough documentation for tracking modifications. Despite
the significant resources required, this meticulous process is vital for upholding Google's high standards of
code quality. The journey of code review isn't always straightforward, and the section provides practical
advice for conducting effective reviews. Key among these is maintaining polite and professional interactions
to ensure timely reviews and avoid conflicts, with reviewers needing to communicate their schedules clearly
and adhere to them to prevent delays. In instances of disagreement, both reviewers and developers must engage
constructively to reach a consensus on necessary changes. Another important tip is to keep changes manageable in
size, aiding reviewers in their task and preventing overwhelm, with detailed commit messages and clear descriptions
of changes being crucial for reviewers to understand the purpose and impact of the changes. Efficient resource use 
is also stressed, suggesting a single reviewer where possible and leveraging automation to streamline the process.
