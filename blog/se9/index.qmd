## Reflection

In this section about Google's software engineering, the focus is on the critical practice of code review
before integrating changes into the main product, highlighting Google's comprehensive approach which emphasizes accuracy,
uniformity, knowledge transfer among developers, and thorough documentation for tracking modifications. Despite
the significant resources required, this meticulous process is vital for upholding Google's high standards of
code quality. The journey of code review isn't always straightforward, and the section provides practical
advice for conducting effective reviews. Key among these is maintaining polite and professional interactions
to ensure timely reviews and avoid conflicts, with reviewers needing to communicate their schedules clearly
and adhere to them to prevent delays. In instances of disagreement, both reviewers and developers must engage
constructively to reach a consensus on necessary changes. Another important tip is to keep changes manageable in
size, aiding reviewers in their task and preventing overwhelm, with detailed commit messages and clear descriptions
of changes being crucial for reviewers to understand the purpose and impact of the changes. Efficient resource use 
is also stressed, suggesting a single reviewer where possible and leveraging automation to streamline the process.

## Action Items

In our current projects, we do a lot of code review before pushing an issue. We, on average, have 3-5 reviewers looking over 
an issue before it is added. We require approval from the Chief Software Architect, a Technical Leader or Professor, and a class 
member. The chapter states that having more than three reviewers is inefficient because some reviewers will simply skim through 
to see if the code runs rather than seeing if it works. If we want to fix this problem and make this process more efficient, 
we can have reviews done by one person who would complete the assessment on time and ensure the change is done correctly.
