## Summary

["What is Software Engineering?"](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch01.html) Goes into a little more detail about what
the difference between programming and software engineering and talks important things
to consider when working as a software engineer. As a software engineer you need to concern
yourself with the longevity of the program you create and are working on and remember to
work as a **team** these are not single person projects. **Longevity** general upkeep and maintenance
are crucial for Software Engineering there are other people who will be using the program
and things change dependencies get updated programming languages update and change and
this may require **adjustment**. Its important to be **proactive** in this because if something
is wrong with the program and you either don't notice or elect to ignore it may cause
even more problems in the future. You need to assume that every part of the program will
be used by someone.

It also needs to be acknowledged you may not be able to do something you want and **trade-offs**
may have to be made being able to make these decisions is what can make a good Software
Engineer. The project needs to be scaled to the amount of people working on it, amount of
time and what is possible with the tools being used. If this isn't done you may find yourself
working on something for long periods of time that ultimately has minimal or no gain compared 
to the effort and time it took to implement. So making these decisions are crucial to ensuring
things get done **effectively** and **efficiently**

As stated before it important to understand that these are not single person operation they
require people to communicate, be organized and be informed of the direction of the project.
If people aren't on the same page then you can have people doing redundant work, irrelevant work
or no work at all getting your project nowhere. Its important to **be critical** on the systems and
rules in place as they may need to change depending on the situation you cant be successful as a
team or organization without some forms of criticism or adjustment so it important for people
to express there opinions and concerns.

## Reflection

While as a team we have made improvements in organization and communication there is still
a long way to go. As many people seem to not be on the same page and are still having
problems running chasten as is making so its very hard for them to contribute. This has
caused to miss deadlines or people being unaware of whats going on or what there supposed
to be doing. Some people don't even know how to run the program there working on. This is
a result on people being uninformed about the program now this isn't completely a result
of poor communication as there is documentation but if someone is falling behind then we
all fall behind there for it is our responsibility to help them So they can succeed and
we can succeed as well.

## What can we do?

We need to take little more responsibility for each other as we have not fully grasped
the importance of teamwork and communication stunting our progress on chasten.

So we need to.

- **Communicate**
- **Help each other**
- **Take responsibility as a unit not an individual**
