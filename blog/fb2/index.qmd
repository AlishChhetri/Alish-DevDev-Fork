## Overview

This is our second post about [The Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/)!
The goal of this post is to relate the material from the book to our progress on
our Chasten tool, with the hope that it will provide valuable lessons on how we
approach designing and developing our own software.

## Summary

The ["Code Coverage"](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Coverage.html) chapter of
this book provides us with insight into specific sorts of tests and their
implementation.
