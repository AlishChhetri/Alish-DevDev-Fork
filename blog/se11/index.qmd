## Reflection

While refelcting on ths section called "Tesing Overview", its important to remember a few things that this section has covered. The
process of testing is something that is super important to remember and utilize.
1. Write test cases
2. Run
3. React to the result

First we write these test cases to make sure that the code we write is well written and very effective. Second we run the
test cases to see what the output or result of these test cases are. And finally we react to what the outcome of the run is. We
change the test cases or complete any task needed that we find from the result of the run. Testing is a super important part of
coding and the way we complete this is also very important. Making this process almost like a trial and error process is a good
way of making sure that these test cases become as efficient as possible.

## Action Items

**Iterative Testing Process:** Encourage the team to adopt an iterative testing process. This involves writing test cases, running them, and reacting to the results. This process should be repeated until the code is well-written and effective.
