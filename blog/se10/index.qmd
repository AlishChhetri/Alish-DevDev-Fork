## Overview

This blog post discusses the [Documentation]
(https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch10.html) chapter in the
[Software Engineering at Google book](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book). The
chapter looks into the importance of documentation in order to ensure that 
ideas in code  are communicated efficiently. Let's dive into the chapter and 
see what constructive tips we can take away from it so that we can improve the 
work of our engineering team!

## Summary



## Reflection

The chapter on [Code Documentation](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch10.html) provides 
us with important information on how documentation is important, despite the
fact that some engineers consider it "downstream" or unimportant. Nonetheless,
despite its appearance of unimportance due to its lack of immediate benefits, the article
shows us how documentation is an extremely important aspect of programming and software
engineering by explaining how it promotes education among software teams as to what the
code does and answering questions about its effectiveness, as well as increasing
professionalism and allowing the formulation of plans related to the rest of the project.
