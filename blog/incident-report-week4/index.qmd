Last week, the Chasten team collectively read 
[Fuzzing: Breaking Things with Random Inputs](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Fuzzer.html)
from [The Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/). Three of us were tasked with reviewing the
articles written by our peers in order to synthesize it and publish on this website; however, due to
sickness and other unforeseen circumstances, we found ourselves split up, confined to working
remotely to review these. By the deadline of Monday, 2023-09-25, we were not able to publish our
summary because we set ourselves up for failure.

We can attribute our failure to a few issues:

1. Rare circumstances prevented us from meeting in person. (obvious)
2. Not all of our team members are aware of the deadlines we have for article reviews.
3. There are varying levels of background on our development team, meaning that some of us may not
produce a summary that sufficiently describes the technical subject we are reviewing.

Needless to say, sickness and personal circumstances will always 'throw a wrench' in the
collaborative process. Given that we are currently working to put our team policies on
[our website](https://www.developerdevelopment.com/), we may see the issue regarding the lack of
informed team members disappear in the following weeks. Lastly, as long as we continue to meet
together and read these articles, the general technical literacy of each team member will
consequentially improve.

Considering the amount of time that this weekly process requires, we advocate to halt our weekly
review of these articles. Our primary focus is to *develop software*. While we can still seek to
improve our technical literacy and learn, we have created a considerable overhead for ourselves.
Doing away with this weekly responsibility will mitigate problems such as this. Additionally, this
will yield more time that can be dedicated to developing chasten.

Finally, it is worth noting that such a circumstance can easily happen again if a team is not
willing to devote their personal time to working on review. We as a team need to own up to managing
our time and balancing it with developing the Chasten code base.
