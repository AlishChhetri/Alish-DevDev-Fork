## Overview

This blog post discusses the
[Unit Testing](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch12.html) chapter in
the [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/toc.html)
book, which is a continuation of the
[Testing Overview](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch11.html) chapter,
focused on the small tests. 

## Summary
The [Unit Testing](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch12.html) chapter in [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/toc.html) delves into the implementation and importance of unit tests, emphasizing their role in optimizing productivity and codebase maintainability. Unit tests, defined as tests for smaller portions of the codebase, such as a single class or method, are highlights for their speed in both execution and creation. They contribute to higher test coverage and act as documentation, illustrating how code is intended to function. 

The chapter underscores the critical need for unit tests to be neither brittle nor unclear. Brittle tests, which fail when code changes occur without introducing actual bugs, can be avoided by ensuring that tests remain unchanged after their initial creation. Unclear tests, lackng output explanations for failures, hinder effective issue diagnosis and resolution. Google's commitment to test maintainability is emphasized, with a focus on tests that remain stable and require minimal modification. Maintainable tests are those that "just work" wihout requiring constant attention. The chapter argues that without maintainability, testing could become a drain on productivity, as quoted as the following statment: 

> After preventing bugs, the most important purpose of
> a test is to improve engineers' productivity. 





## Reflection



## Action Items

The concepts and information presented into this chapter relate to the work done
recently in [The Debugging Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/) as well, in
that it concerns the creation and execution of tests. In particular, the
guidelines presented in this chapter can be employed alongside the techniques
being studied from that other source in order to develop the most efficient
tests possible. Demystifying tests in this way will also serve to encourage test
writing among our engineers, allowing them to create clear tests that will last
for hopefully as long as necessary.
