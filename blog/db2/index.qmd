## Overview

This article covers the ["Tracing Executions"]
(https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Tracer.html) chapter from [The Debugging
Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Intro_Debugging.html). In this article
we will summarize the chapter and discuss how its content could be utilized
within the context of our [Chasten](https://github.com/AstuteSource/chasten)
and [Cellveyor](https://github.com/GatorEducator/cellveyor) tools.

## Summary



## Reflection

After reading this chapter, we have a better understanding of what tracing
entails. We have learned that there are several different ways to trace, from
simply using the `settrace()` function to writing a complex `Tracer` class with
conditional logic. We learned about frames and all the different variables
within them. We learned how tracing can help improve the efficency of the
debugging process. With this knowledge, we can better understand the process of
tracing and be able to implement tracing into our own programs.


## Action Items

After reading the article, our focus is on refining debugging by emphasizing the 
cause-and-effect chain, enhancing test case development, and integrating the 
scientific method. This approach proves beneficial in diagnosing and resolving
bugs, fostering a methodical and systematic debugging process. Documentation 
practices will be updated, and a commitment to continuous learning will be 
realized through training programs. These actions aim to empower our team with
a robust methodology, drawn from the insights of this chapter, enhancing our 
ability to debug code effectively. And help us to foster new ideas for ways to 
improve Chasten and Cellveyor.
