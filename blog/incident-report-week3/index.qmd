The overarching struggle with getting out our first blog post regarding `Software
Engineering At Google` mostly centered on the team's lack of proper communication
and mutual understanding - of Github and of the task at hand. This was amplified
by a lack of secure and consistent access to WiFi, and of a universal
understanding of the terms used to describe the task.

In order to tackle these issues, the team laid out a new methodology for the
completion of tasks, involving the assignment of smaller committees to each
task. This is intended to facillate closer and more accurate communication among
teammates and to ensure clarity of assigned work. Part of obtaining this clarity
is to assign each committee a 'Github Expert', someone confident enough in their
understanding of Github flow and functions to help guide other committee members.
Through this, we aim to also allow an opportunity for those less experienced to
get a closer look, as the teams are small. Specifically, for Professional Precis
Synthesis and Publishing, we chose to have teams of three who can split the work
and discuss with each other to ensure our work's quality.

The element of this left to properly establish is when in our schedule the
committees for each week will be determined. Some possibilities are: every
Monday, after our demo on Tuesday, and via the project's Discord. This will
be decided by 10:00AM Monday, September 18 2023.
