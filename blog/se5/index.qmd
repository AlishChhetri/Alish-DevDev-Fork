## Overview

This blog post discusses the
["Engineering for Equity"](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch03.html)
chapter in the
[Software Engineering at Google book](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book). This
article's goal is to make a point of the engineer's responsibility in ensuring
that their project meets the needs of the largest possible audience or userbase.

## Summary

This chapter goes over where Google failed to reach the ideal standard for
inclusivity and how this can be made up for in the future, as a company&mdash;wide
effort. The demographics of the software engineers at Google do not reflect
those that use their products, and as such their biases were incorporated into
their projects, such as facial recognition software.

In order to remedy this issue, there are several proposed steps or areas of
focus to take into consideration. These are outlined in the
**Value Versus Outcomes** section, as summarised and paraphrased below.

1. Who are the ones building the product? Does this represent those the product
is being built for? If not, how is that being taken into account?

2. Assume everyone will use it, and use this to take into account the one that
will struggle the most. Design with that person or demographic in mind, in order
to ensure that accessibility is built in.

3. Building on the previous point; does the data show that your efforts
succeeded? If not, where was the failure point? How can this be fixed and then
prevented in the future?

These are an amalgamation of the five points given in the
**Value Versus Outcomes** section, and how it asks software engineers to create
solutions instead of being part of the problem in order to ensure equity.

## Reflection

TODO

## Action Items

This chapter offers invaluable insight for software engineers and organizations, emphasizing the importance of integrating inclusivity and diversity into the product development process. It 
advocates for a user-centered approach that caters to individuals confronting various challenges and calls for collaboration with diversity and inclusion experts. While the immediate relevance 
to our current class project may be limited, the principles discussed remain significant in our preparation for the workforce. In the context of Chasten's future users, especially AC CIS 
students, we should place a strong emphasis on making our code highly readable, recalling our own initial challenges in understanding the codebase. Furthermore, we can leverage our experiences 
in creating the program to assist future students in improving it, ensuring its accessibility and usability for a wider range of users.
