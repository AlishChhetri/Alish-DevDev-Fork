### Course Description

A human-centric study of the principles used during the engineering of
high-quality software systems. In addition to examining the human behaviors and
social processes undergirding software development methodologies, students
participate in teams tasked with designing, developing, and delivering a
significant software application for a customer. During a weekly laboratory
session, students use state-of-the-art software engineering, management, and
communication tools to complete projects, reporting on their results through
both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their
own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops
are available for use during class and lab sessions.

- **Prerequisite**: CMPSC 101
- **Distribution Requirements**: SB, SP.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="What do these distribution requirements mean?" collapse="false"}

- **Scientific Process and Knowledge (SP)**: Courses involving Scientific
Process and Knowledge aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be
known about the natural world; apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis
and synthesis of scientific information; and create scientifically literate
citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

- **Learning Outcome**: Students who successfully complete this requirement will
demonstrate an understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific
inquiry.

- **Social Behavior and Institutions (SB)**: The study of Social Behavior and
Institutions encompasses a broad range of disciplines that use a variety of
methodologies to describe, explain, or predict human behavior, social processes,
and institutional structures as they interact with their environments.

- **Learning Outcome**: Students who successfully complete this requirement will
demonstrate an understanding of at least one methodology used to describe,
explain, or predict human behavior at the level of the individual, small group,
institution, organization, community, or population.
