### Course Description

A human-centric study of the principles used during the engineering of
high-quality software systems. In addition to examining the human behaviors and
social processes undergirding software development methodologies, students
participate in teams tasked with designing, developing, and delivering a
significant software application for a customer. During a weekly laboratory
session, students use state-of-the-art software engineering, management, and
communication tools to complete projects, reporting on their results through
both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their
own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops
are available for use during class and lab sessions.

- **Prerequisite**: CMPSC 101
- **Distribution Requirements**: SB, SP.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="What do these distribution requirements mean?" collapse="false"}

- **Scientific Process and Knowledge (SP)**: Courses involving Scientific
Process and Knowledge aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be
known about the natural world; apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis
and synthesis of scientific information; and create scientifically literate
citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

- **Learning Outcome**: Students who successfully complete this requirement will
demonstrate an understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific
inquiry.

- **Social Behavior and Institutions (SB)**: The study of Social Behavior and
Institutions encompasses a broad range of disciplines that use a variety of
methodologies to describe, explain, or predict human behavior, social processes,
and institutional structures as they interact with their environments.

- **Learning Outcome**: Students who successfully complete this requirement will
demonstrate an understanding of at least one methodology used to describe,
explain, or predict human behavior at the level of the individual, small group,
institution, organization, community, or population.

### Learning Objectives

Allegheny College’s educational program is designed so that its graduates are able to:

- **AC-1**: Think critically and creatively.

- **AC-2**: Communicate clearly and persuasively as speakers and writers.

- **AC-3**: Invoke multiple ways of understanding to organize and evaluate
evidence, and to interpret and make sense of their experiences and the
experiences of others.

- **AC-4**: Apply their knowledge and learning to engage in informed debate,
and to analyze and solve problems.

Computer Science 203 at Allegheny College is a core course in the Software
Engineering major. Graduates with the Software Engineering major attain these
learning objectives:

- **SE-1**: While working in a team, can effectively design, implement,
evaluate, improve, and document a solution to a problem delivered as a
maintainable software system.

  - Enables the attainment of **AC-1** and **AC-4**

- **SE-2**: Demonstrates competency in the theories, models, and practices of
project domains that require the engineering of software.

  - Enables the attainment of **AC-1** and **AC-3**

- **SE-3**: Can effectively manage and predict the cost, scope, and deadline of
a software engineering project.

  - Enables the attainment of **AC-2** and **AC-4**

- **SE-4**: Uses effective oral and written communication methods to explain
both the technical and product-use details of a software artifact.

  - Enables the attainment of **AC-2** and **AC-3**

The following list itemizes the three main types of activities in Computer
Science 203 and illustrates their connection to the course learning objectives:

- **Professional Development**: **SE-3** and **SE-4**
- **Technical Development**: **SE-1** and **SE-2**
- **Project Development**:  **SE-1** through **SE-4**

Finally, the following list illustrates how the learning objectives for
Allegheny College are attained through the successful completion of Computer
Science 203.

- **AC-1** is attained through the course learning objectives **SE-1** and **SE-2**
- **AC-2** is attained through the course learning objectives **SE-3** and **SE-4**
- **AC-3** is attained through the course learning objectives **SE-2** and **SE-4**
- **AC-4** is attained through the course learning objectives **SE-1** and **SE-3**

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Key Insight" collapse="false"}

Students who develop both **professionally** and **technically** are effectively
undertaking the task of **developer development**, which is both the theme and
goal of this web site's content!

### Course Textbooks

- [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) - abbreviated on this site as **SE**
- [Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/) -- abbreviated on this site as **FB**
- [Debugging Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/) -- abbreviated on this site as **DB**

Students who complete all of the work on the [course
schedule](../schedule/index.qmd) will read and write a professional précis for
**twelve** reading assignments in **SE** (i.e., **SE1** through **SE12**),
**nine** reading assignments in **FB** (i.e., **FB1** through **FB9**), and
**four** reading assignments in **DB** (i.e., **DB1** through **DB4**).

The course textbooks are connected to the three main type of course activities
in these ways:

- **Professional Development** as a software engineer:
  - Active engagement with content in **SE**
  - Publication of a professional précis of each reading assignment on personal web site
  - Publication of a team-based executive summary on this web site
- **Technical Development** as a software engineer:
  - Active engagement with content in **FB** and **DB**
  - Publication of a professional précis of each reading assignment on personal web site
  - Publication of an team-based executive summary on this web site
- **Project Development** to hone professional and technical knowledge and skills:
  - Application of **SE** to technical and professional tasks during project engineering
  - Application of **FB** and **DB** to the technical tasks during project engineering
  - Integration of professional and technical skills during project engineering

All students are responsible for taking the following steps in regards to **FB**
and **DB**:

- Install an appropriate version of both **FB** and **DB** (both currently designate Python `3.10.2`)
- Create a virtual environment for the book's dependencies with `python -m venv venv`
- Install the book's dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install all platform-dependent binaries for the book's dependencies (e.g., `graphviz`)
- Troubleshoot all of the issues that arise during the installation of the book's dependencies
- Enter into the virtual environment for a text with `source venv/bin/activate`
- Run a Jupyter Lab server using a command like `venv/bin/jupyter-lab`
- Use the Jupyter Lab server to locate and execute notebooks for chapters in **FB** and **DB**
- Use the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) system to publish a professional précis for each reading assignment
- Collaboratively use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to publish an article's executive summary to this web site
