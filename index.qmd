![**Developing developers so that they can develop better software!**](images/Developer-Development-Horizontal-Logo.svg){fig-align="center"}

Regardless of the role or the company or the project in which they find
themselves, a software engineer is always a *developing developer*. Like the
word "developer" in the above logo, developers always have a "missing piece" of
the "D" in their developer skills. Put in another way, all developers have a
professional skill that they have not yet honed, new technologies that they have
yet to explore, program features that they have not yet implemented, or
nefarious bugs that they have not yet found and fixed! Always working to
establish a confidence in their program's correctness, a developing developer
aims to engineer and ship high-quality software that is designed, documented,
tested, and maintained according to industry best practices.

With the goal of enabling effective developer development, this web site
features a sixteen-week schedule filled with activities that support
professional development, technical development, and project development.

Is this challenging? *Yep*! Will you make mistakes along the way to emerging as
a proactive programmer? *Of course*! Are there many benefits to being a
proactive programmer? *Yes*! If you want to learn more about proactive
programming, you are invited study the [proactive
skills](proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/) and complete the
projects in [data
abstraction](data-abstraction/introduction-data-abstraction.md) and [discrete
structures](discrete-structures/introduction-discrete-structures.md).

Are you nervous about getting started or afraid that becoming a proactive
programmer will prove to be too overwhelming? Don't worry, you can rely on the
team of [programming
experts](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/graphs/contributors)
who have crafted activities that will help you to hone your technical and
professional skills. If you get stuck on this adventure you will find a
welcoming [community](proactive-community/introduction-proactive-community.md)
of like-minded learners who can answer your technical questions, make
suggestions for improvement, and relate to your struggles.
